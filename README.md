# 1D Advection Diffusion with Finite Difference Method
By simplifying differential term into algebriac equations, some of the more complex problems can be solved numerically. In FDM, a mesh grid is created and the properties of each node in the grid will then be estimated using its neighbor nodes and its previous condition.<br>
In this notebook, a simple 1D advection diffusion problem is solved with FDM.

## How to use on your local machine?
1. Creat a virtual environment. For example, in windows, open the cmd in a folder and type the command `python -m venv {any_name_you_like}`.
2. Activate the venv by `{any_name_you_like}\Scripts\activate`.
3. Install the requirements with `pip install -r requiremets.txt`.
4. Open the jupyter note book in any IDE and set the kernel to the venv you just made.
